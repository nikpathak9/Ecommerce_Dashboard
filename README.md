## Design Decisions & Improvements

- **Built reusable and responsive components to ensure consistent design and reduce code duplication.**
- **Implemented a custom ThemeContext to manage dark and light themes dynamically throughout the app.**
- **Added skeleton loaders to improve user experience during data fetch delays and simulate loading animations for better feedback.**
- **Chose Vite for its fast build times**
- **Used Recharts and Shadcn for clean, minimalistic charts with animation support to enhance the dashboardâ€™s UX.**

## Challenges Faced
- **Ensuring all layouts remained fully responsive across different screen sizes, which was crucial for usability, resolved by leveraging Tailwindâ€™s responsive utility classes and testing across multiple viewports to fine-tune layout breakpoints.**

- **Creating a consistent theme toggle experience across nested components, solved by implementing a centralized ThemeContext and ensuring all components consumed the context properly to reflect the correct theme dynamically.**

- **Managing animation resets when switching routes and loading skeletons caused visual inconsistencies, fixed by introducing controlled loading states and delaying skeletons with subtle transitions for a smoother experience.**

- **The animation on charts was not consistent for each render, which was not optimal, solved by generating a random identification key to force consistent animation re-renders.**
